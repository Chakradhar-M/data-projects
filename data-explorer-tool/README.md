# Data Explorer Tool

## Overview

The **Data Explorer Tool** is a Python-based web application built using **Streamlit**. The tool is designed to automate basic data exploration tasks, allowing users to quickly upload datasets and explore them with ease. This tool is particularly useful for data analysts, data scientists, and anyone working with datasets for the first time. By automating repetitive tasks, this tool makes data exploration faster, more efficient, and more organized.

## Motivation

I have participated in over 10 Power BI data competitions. In the beginning, I used to explore datasets manually, noting down everything in a book with a pen. As I continued participating in these competitions, I realized that **data exploration** is an essential part of the process. Instead of performing this manually, I started writing Python scripts to automate the process for each competition. 

I came across **Streamlit** and the concept of **data apps**, and that's when I had the idea to create a tool that automates data exploration for various datasets. This tool would help me save time and would be extremely useful to anyone who wants to quickly get insights from a dataset.

## Features

- **Upload a file**: Users can upload a dataset(csv/xlsx) and start analyzing the data.
- **Quick Data Analysis**: The tool performs basic data exploration, such as displaying column types, summary statistics, and the first few rows of the dataset.
- **Intuitive Interface**: The interface is simple and user-friendly, with easy-to-understand controls for data exploration.

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit** for creating the web app.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations.
- **NumPy** for handling numerical data.
